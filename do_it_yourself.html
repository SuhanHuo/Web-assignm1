        <h2>(1) Please recall a recent situation that made you anxious and write about the trigger that triggered your anxiety.</h2>   
        <p>Example: You ate a snack while doing your homework at 11 o 'clock last night. 
            Unconsciously you ate three packets of potato chips. After eating, you suddenly felt that you must become particularly fat and began to worry. 
            Trigger: Too many late-night snacks</p>
        </aside>
        <aside>        
            <h2>(3) Please write down the cognitive logic behind anxiety</h2>
            <p>Example: You think that eating three packets of potato chips at midnight will make you very, very fat and you will never lose weight again.</p>
        </aside>
        <aside>
            <h2>(5) Please write down your improved thoughts after the future occurrence of the trigger that makes you anxious</h2>  
            <p>Example: Eating three packets of potato chips at a time may make you feel a little upset when you go to bed tonight, but as long as you exercise and eat properly tomorrow, this little binge is actually nothing.</p>

        <aside>
        <h2>(2) Please recall what emotional and physical changes occurred to you during the situation.</h2>   
        <p>Example: Your mind is tense, your heart is racing, and you hate and hate yourself.</p> 
        </aside>
        <aside>
            <h2>(4) Write down another thought that challenges your cognitive logic</h2>
            <p>In fact, three packets of potato chips will not immediately become fat, only eat this every night, lasting one or two months will become a lot of weight. In fact, you weigh less than 55 under the height of 170, even if a little fat is good.</p> 
        </aside>
        <aside>
        <h2>(6) Finally, please re-rate your anxiety after having improved thinking on a scale of 0-100!</h2>
